#nope.c

nope.c is a C language-based ultra-light software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications. Think node.js for C programmers.

Just put your code inside the function void server(int client, const char * queryString, const char * method) in server.c and you are good to go.

Default port is 4242. Set environment variable 'PORT' to change it.

That's really it. The source comes with a simple example that prints "Hello World" to get you started.

###Concurrency Handling

You can choose between:

1. Single process with non-blocking IO with select() (Default)

2. Single process with non-blocking IO with epoll()  (Define EPOLL when compiling)

3. Multiple fork()ed processeses with blocking IO (Set CHILDREN environment variable to greater than zero)

###Note to Contributors

Thank you for making this a wonderful project!

Here's our preferred formatting style:

  `find . \( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' \) -exec indent --no-tabs  --linux-style --line-length 90 --indent-level 4 -bli0 \{\} \;`
