ritchie is a C language-based software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications. Think node.js for C programmers. It

Just put your code inside the function server_main() in server.c and you are good to go.

Default port is 32000. Set environment variable 'PORT' to change it.

That's really it. The source comes with a simple example that prints "Hello World" to get your started.
